## Planning and Development Process

We implemented this project using agile methodology, first by specifying the MVP for this project and prioritising it's features.
then we divided the features and tasks between the team members, and each team member started working on her individual task.
During the whole project we was sharing and helping each other.
Finally we merged our work and made sure everything is working perfectly.
